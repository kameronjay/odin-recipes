        <h3>The best chicken karaage recipe!</h3>
        <p>This is a simple yet delicious Japanese-style fried chicken flavored with ginger, garlic and sake and soy sauce.
            Serve as an appetizer or with rice and veggies to make a yummy meal. It even tastes good cold; my mom used to 
            make this to take with us on picnics.

        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <uo>
            <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon sake (Japanese rice wine)</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons grated fresh ginger</li>

        <h2>Steps:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine soy sauce, sake, and ginger in a large bowl. Add chicken; turn to coat. 
                Cover with plastic wrap and let marinate in the refrigerator, about 30 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
            </li>
            <li>
                Place cornstarch in a large resealable plastic bag. Add chicken; seal bag and 
                toss until chicken is coated with cornstarch.
            </li>
            <li>
                Fry chicken in batches until juices run clear and it is golden brown, 
                2 to 3 minutes. Drain on paper towels or on a wire rack.

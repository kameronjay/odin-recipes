        <h3>A great chicken teriyaki recipe!</h3>
        <p>
            This recipe is a family favorite. I've served it to friends at parties and everyone always asks for the recipe... 
            but shhhhhh...it's a secret.

                In a medium bowl, mix together the soy sauce and mayonnaise.

                Place the chicken onto the grill with a thick coating of the marinade. Discard remaining marinade. 
                Cook for about 10 minutes per side, or until chicken is firm and juices run clear.
